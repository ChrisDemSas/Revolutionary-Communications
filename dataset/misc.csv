"While many tour companies are making strides in promoting eco-tourism, there’s still a lot of room for improvement. For instance, it’s crucial that operators ensure their sustainability claims are backed by actual practices rather than just marketing fluff. Some guides are doing a decent job educating tourists about local wildlife, but others could use a wake-up call on respecting sacred sites and minimizing their impact. The inconsistency in how eco-friendly practices are applied can be a major buzzkill. It’s time for everyone to step up and put their money where their mouth is.", 6
"Tour operators are starting to get the hang of eco-tourism, but it’s a bit of a mixed bag.

"Tourism here is moving in the right direction with increased focus on eco-friendly practices, but there’s still a lot to be done. Many tour companies are making a genuine effort, but some are still falling short of truly sustainable practices.

Tour guides often do a good job, but there’s a need for more comprehensive training on how to handle tourists who aren’t as eco-conscious. Improving these areas could make a big difference.", 7
"There's definitely progress being made in eco-tourism, but let’s be real—there’s still a fair bit of room for improvement. Some tour companies are all talk and no action, claiming to be eco-friendly while still using practices that harm the environment. It’s not uncommon to see guides who are passionate but lack the necessary training to effectively communicate the importance of sustainability. More transparency and accountability from tour operators, along with better training for guides, would make a huge difference.", 6
"While it’s awesome to see a push towards more sustainable tourism, there’s still some work to be done. Tour operators are generally making an effort, but the execution is often hit or miss. Some tours are incredibly well-organized with a strong focus on eco-friendly practices, but others could use a serious upgrade. Guides sometimes lack the depth of knowledge needed to properly educate tourists about environmental impact. It would be great to see a more standardized approach to eco-tourism across the board.", 7
"Many tour companies are making strides in sustainability, but there’s still a fair bit of inconsistency. While some operators are genuinely committed to reducing their environmental footprint, others are merely scratching the surface. It’s common to see a disconnect between what’s advertised and what’s actually practiced. Guides do their best, but without uniform training, the message about eco-responsibility can get lost. A more cohesive and transparent approach to eco-tourism would definitely enhance the overall experience.", 7
"Tour companies are stepping up their game in eco-tourism, which is fantastic, but let’s not kid ourselves—there’s still a lot to be done. The commitment to sustainability is there, but the implementation often falls short. For instance, while some tours are incredibly green, others still contribute to pollution. Guides sometimes miss the mark in educating tourists about the importance of respecting local environments. More rigorous standards and training could help in making these efforts more effective.", 6
"Tourism here is definitely improving with more focus on eco-friendly practices, but let’s face it—there’s room for improvement. Some tour operators are nailing it with their sustainable practices, but others are just ticking boxes. The inconsistency is a bit of a letdown. Tour guides often do a great job, but without a universal standard, some miss out on key points about eco-responsibility. Standardizing practices and providing better training could make a huge impact.", 7
"Eco-tourism is becoming more prevalent, and that’s awesome, but we’ve still got some work to do. Tour companies are generally moving in the right direction, but the level of commitment varies. Some tours are spot-on with their environmental practices, but others could seriously step up their game. Guides sometimes lack the detailed knowledge needed to properly inform tourists about sustainability. Greater consistency and training would make a big difference.", 7
"While many tour operators are embracing eco-tourism, there’s a noticeable gap between intention and action. It’s great to see the focus on sustainability, but some companies are still not fully committed to reducing their environmental impact. Guides can be hit or miss in terms of how well they educate tourists on responsible behavior. A more standardized approach and thorough training would help bridge this gap and make the eco-tourism experience better for everyone.", 6
"Tourism is definitely becoming greener, which is great, but the implementation is often uneven. Some tour operators are doing an excellent job with eco-friendly practices, but others are still lagging. The inconsistency can be frustrating, especially when it comes to guides who may not be fully versed in the importance of sustainability. A more uniform approach and better training for all involved could make a significant difference.", 7
"Tour companies are making some progress in eco-tourism, but there’s still a lot of room for growth. While some tours are impressively eco-friendly, others are far from it.

More focus on transparent practices and comprehensive training would be beneficial.", 7
